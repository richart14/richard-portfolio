        <p>
          I've always felt an affinity for logical thinking and have always found problem solving to be a pasttime rather than a chore. I am a board game fanantic
          and I love learning new instructions, rules, and game structures. At the start of 2018 was when I decide I would take a leap of faith and commit to web development
          full time and I have not regretted it since. I enjoyed learning all the languages, wireframes, libraries and anything inbetween.
